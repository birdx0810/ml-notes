# time-series-analysis
This repository has some basic notes and tutorials for performing time-series analysis using deep learning techniques. Tasks include imputation, classification, regression, anomaly detection, and pre-training.

Notable implementations include:
- Classification
    - [ ] FCN ([Wang et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06455))
    - [ ] ResNet ([Wang et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06455))
    - [ ] TimeNet ([Malhotra et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08838))
    - [ ] LSTM-FCN ([Karim et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05206))
    - [ ] ALSTM-FCN ([Karim et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05206))
    - [ ] MLSTM-FCN ([Karim et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04503))
    - [ ] ConvTimeNet ([Kashiparekh et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12546))
